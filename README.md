# Clock Using Pure JS

This project is a simple analog clock implemented using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The clock visually represents the current time with hour, minute, and second hands, and includes a ticking sound effect.

## Features

- **Analog Clock:** The clock face is styled with CSS and uses a background image (`clock.png`) for the dial.
- **Live Time Update:** The hour, minute, and second hands update every second to show the current local time.
- **Ticking Sound:** A ticking sound (`tick.mp3`) plays in the background. Due to browser policies, it may require a user interaction (such as a click) to start the audio.

- **Start Button:** The "Start Clock" button allows users to start the clock and the ticking sound.
